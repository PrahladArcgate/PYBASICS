# Built in function range:
#  (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
#  It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment
# for m in range(2,9):
#     print(m)


# For Theree value

for n in range(0,9,2):
 print(n)


# a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
# for i in range(len(a)):
#    print(i, a[i])
